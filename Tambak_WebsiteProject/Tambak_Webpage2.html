        <h1>Jane Austen</h1>
        <p class="abt">Jane Austen, born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire, England -died July 18, 1817, in
            Winchester, Hampshire, was an English author who profoundly shaped the modern novel by portraying the lives of
            ordinary people in everyday situations. Throughout her lifetime, she authored four novels: "Sense and
            Sensibility" (1811), "Pride and Prejudice" (1813), "Mansfield Park" (1814), and "Emma" (1815). In addition to
            these, "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey" were published posthumously in 1817. Through her vivid portrayals
            of early 19th-century English middle-class life, Austen not only established the novel of manners for her era
            but also created enduring classics that continued to be both critically acclaimed and popular for more than
            two centuries after her demise. Her literary works remain a testament to her lasting influence.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Jane Austen is credited with popularizing the literary technique known as "free indirect
                discourse" or "free indirect style." While she didn't invent this style, she was among the early writers to
                consistently employ it in her works. Her use of this technique anticipated later authors like Virginia Woolf
                and James Joyce, who expanded upon it in early twentieth-century novels.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">I would suggest that anyone who hasn't already done so should delve into her literary works! In the meantime, here are Jane Austen quotes that perfectly encapsulate her essence:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“It isn't what we say or think that defines us, but what we do.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Sense and Sensibility, 1811</p>

            <p class="quote">“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Emma, 1815</p>

            <p class="quote">“Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Mansfield Park, 1814</p>

            <p class="quote">“There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Pride and Prejudice, 1813</p>

            <p class="quote">“Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Northanger Abbey, 1818</p>

        <h1>Holly Jackson</h1>
        <p class="abt">Holly Jackson was born in 1992. She grew up in Buckinghamshire and started writing stories from a young age, 
		completing her first attempt at a novel aged fifteen. She graduated from the University of Nottingham with a 1st class degree 
		and a master’s in English, focusing on literary linguistics and creative writing. She lives in London and her hobbies include 
		binge-playing video games and pointing out grammatical errors in street signs.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Holly Jackson has sold in over 25 languages, and has sold millions of copies both 
			here and in the US, and around the world. A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder was a Sunday Times and NY Times no.1 bestseller and the
			series has spent over a year on the NYT bestseller list. It has won the National Book Award for Children's Book of the Year in 2020, 
			Waterstones Children's Book of the Year, longlisted for the Branford Boase, and was a Waterstones Paperback of the Year. It was an Observer
			Book of the Year and WH Smith Thumping Good Read. It was published in the UK and in the US and has been translated in many other languages around the world.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">Her novels are undeniably enthralling, and I wholeheartedly recommend! Below, I've gathered some of the finest quotes by Holly Jackson:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“The people you love weren’t algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm’s length across a decimal point.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, 2019</p>

            <p class="quote">“But sometimes remembering isn’t for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, 2019</p>

            <p class="quote">“A quietness settled over the room, a quietness that wasn’t the absence of sound, it was its own living thing, stifling in the spaces between them.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Good Girl, Bad Blood, 2020</p>

            <p class="quote">“She wasn’t fine, but that was the whole point. There was no running away from this; she’d asked for it. She needed it. This was how she would make herself fine again. And the scarier it got, the more perfect the fit. Out of the grey area, into something she could comprehend, something she could live with. Black and white. Good and bad. Thank you.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- As Good As Dead, 2021</p>

            <p class="quote">“Just as funny, as ridiculous, as the notion of decomposing bodies and the way we all become one. Disappearing wasn't mysterious, it wasn't thrilling; it was cold bodies with stiff limbs and purpling patches as the blood inside pooled.”</p>
