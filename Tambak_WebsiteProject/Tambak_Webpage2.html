        <h1>Jane Austen</h1>
        <p class="abt">Jane Austen, born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire, England -died July 18, 1817, in
            Winchester, Hampshire, was an English author who profoundly shaped the modern novel by portraying the lives of
            ordinary people in everyday situations. Throughout her lifetime, she authored four novels: "Sense and
            Sensibility" (1811), "Pride and Prejudice" (1813), "Mansfield Park" (1814), and "Emma" (1815). In addition to
            these, "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey" were published posthumously in 1817. Through her vivid portrayals
            of early 19th-century English middle-class life, Austen not only established the novel of manners for her era
            but also created enduring classics that continued to be both critically acclaimed and popular for more than
            two centuries after her demise. Her literary works remain a testament to her lasting influence.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Jane Austen is credited with popularizing the literary technique known as "free indirect
                discourse" or "free indirect style." While she didn't invent this style, she was among the early writers to
                consistently employ it in her works. Her use of this technique anticipated later authors like Virginia Woolf
                and James Joyce, who expanded upon it in early twentieth-century novels.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">I would suggest that anyone who hasn't already done so should delve into her literary works! In the meantime, here are Jane Austen quotes that perfectly encapsulate her essence:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“It isn't what we say or think that defines us, but what we do.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Sense and Sensibility, 1811</p>

            <p class="quote">“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Emma, 1815</p>

            <p class="quote">“Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Mansfield Park, 1814</p>

            <p class="quote">“There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Pride and Prejudice, 1813</p>

            <p class="quote">“Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Northanger Abbey, 1818</p>

        <h1>Holly Jackson</h1>
        <p class="abt">Holly Jackson was born in 1992. She grew up in Buckinghamshire and started writing stories from a young age, 
		completing her first attempt at a novel aged fifteen. She graduated from the University of Nottingham with a 1st class degree 
		and a master’s in English, focusing on literary linguistics and creative writing. She lives in London and her hobbies include 
		binge-playing video games and pointing out grammatical errors in street signs.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Holly Jackson has sold in over 25 languages, and has sold millions of copies both 
			here and in the US, and around the world. A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder was a Sunday Times and NY Times no.1 bestseller and the
			series has spent over a year on the NYT bestseller list. It has won the National Book Award for Children's Book of the Year in 2020, 
			Waterstones Children's Book of the Year, longlisted for the Branford Boase, and was a Waterstones Paperback of the Year. It was an Observer
			Book of the Year and WH Smith Thumping Good Read. It was published in the UK and in the US and has been translated in many other languages around the world.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">Her novels are undeniably enthralling, and I wholeheartedly recommend! Below, I've gathered some of the finest quotes by Holly Jackson:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“The people you love weren’t algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm’s length across a decimal point.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, 2019</p>

            <p class="quote">“But sometimes remembering isn’t for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, 2019</p>

            <p class="quote">“A quietness settled over the room, a quietness that wasn’t the absence of sound, it was its own living thing, stifling in the spaces between them.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Good Girl, Bad Blood, 2020</p>

            <p class="quote">“She wasn’t fine, but that was the whole point. There was no running away from this; she’d asked for it. She needed it. This was how she would make herself fine again. And the scarier it got, the more perfect the fit. Out of the grey area, into something she could comprehend, something she could live with. Black and white. Good and bad. Thank you.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- As Good As Dead, 2021</p>

            <p class="quote">“Just as funny, as ridiculous, as the notion of decomposing bodies and the way we all become one. Disappearing wasn't mysterious, it wasn't thrilling; it was cold bodies with stiff limbs and purpling patches as the blood inside pooled.”</p>

        <h1>Edgar Allan Poe</h1>
        <p class="abt">Edgar Allan Poe, born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts, -died October 7, 1849, in Baltimore, Maryland, was an 
		American short-story writer, poet, critic, and editor renowned for his cultivation of mystery and the macabre. His tale "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" 
		(1841) initiated the modern detective story, and the atmosphere in his tales of horror remains unrivaled in American fiction. His "The Raven" (1845) numbers 
		among the best-known poems in the national literature.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Edgar Allan Poe's prominent standing in world literature primarily stems from his brilliant and deep short stories, poems,
		    and critical theories. He laid the foundation for a highly influential rationale for the short form in both poetry and fiction. In literary accounts and reference 
		    works, he is recognized as the mastermind behind the modern short story. Poe also played a pivotal role as the primary precursor of the "art for art's sake" movement 
		    in 19th-century European literature. While earlier critics often concentrated on moral or ideological aspects, Poe directed his critical attention toward the intricate 
		    details of style and construction that determined the success or failure of a literary work.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">His writings are truly remarkable, and I highly encourage you to explore them! Here is a collection of some of the most notable quotes by Edgar Allan Poe:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“Those who dream by day are cognisant of many things which escape those who dream only by night"</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Eleonora, 1841</p>

            <p class="quote">“Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, 1838</p>

            <p class="quote">“There is no exquisite beauty… without some strangeness in the proportion”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Ligeia, 1838</p>

            <p class="quote">“Never to suffer would never to have been blessed”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Mesmeric Revelation, 1849</p>

            <p class="quote">“I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.”</p>

        <h1>Sylvia Plath</h1>
        <p class="abt"> Sylvia Plath, born on October 27, 1932, in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., and died on February 11, 1963, in London, England, was a highly 
		influential American poet. Renowned for her distinctive voice, she is best known for powerful works such as the poems "Daddy" and "Lady Lazarus" and her 
		novel, The Bell Jar. Plath's literary contributions are deeply rooted in her personal experiences, portraying a profound sense of alienation, self-destruction, and nature. 
		Her writings, often marked by intense emotional exploration, provide a poignant reflection on the challenges faced by women in mid-20th-century America. Plath's impact 
		extends beyond her literary achievements, making her a significant figure in the exploration of mental health and the female experience.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> At the tender age of eight, Plath unveiled her first poem to the public. Displaying her prodigious talent, she emerged 
			victorious in numerous literary competitions. During her high school years, she achieved the remarkable feat of selling her maiden poem to The Christian Science 
			Monitor and her inaugural short story to Seventeen magazine. Commencing her academic journey at Smith College in 1951, Plath further solidified her literary 
			prowess by securing a co-victory in the 1952 Mademoiselle magazine fiction contest.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to dive into her literary wonders! With that in mind, here are some Sylvia Plath quotes that authentically embody her essence:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“Perhaps some day I'll crawl back home, beaten, defeated. But not as long as I can make stories out of my heartbreak, beauty out of sorrow.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, 1982</p>

            <p class="quote">“God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of "parties" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. 
			And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from 
			being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible
			and overpowering.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, 1982</p>

            <p class="quote">“I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery—air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, "This is what it is to be happy.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- The Bell Jar, 1963</p>

            <p class="quote">“If you pluck out the heart
			To find what makes it move,
            you'll halt the clock
            that syncopates our love.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Admonition, 1959</p>

        <h1>Franz Kafka</h1>
        <p class="abt"> Franz Kafka, born on July 3, 1883, in Prague, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic) and died on June 3, 1924, in Kierling, 
		near Vienna, Austria, was a German-language writer renowned for his visionary fiction. His significant works, notably the novel "Der Prozess" (1925; The Trial) and 
		the story "Die Verwandlung" (1915; The Metamorphosis), eloquently articulate the anxieties and alienation experienced by many during the tumultuous 20th century in 
		Europe and North America. Kafka's contributions have left an indelible mark on the literary landscape, exploring themes that resonate across time and cultures.</p>
        <div class="abt2-container">
            <p class="abt2"><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Kafka's legacy is so influential that the term 'Kafkaesque' is widely employed to characterize surreal, uncanny situations 
			or events reminiscent of his bizarre narratives. His native city, Prague, pays homage to him with two monuments and the Kafka Museum, established in 2005, devoted to 
			his life and works. The city further honors Kafka's influence by presenting the Franz Kafka Prize annually, a prestigious award that not only includes a $10,000 prize but
			also confers a significant boost to the recipient's reputation.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="q">His works are truly captivating, and I highly recommend them! Here, I've compiled some of the most exceptional quotes by Franz Kafka:</p>

        <div class="quotes-container">
            <p class="quote">“Moreover, perhaps it isn’t love when I say you are what I love the most - you are the knife I turn inside myself, this is love.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Letters to Milena, 1952</p>

            <p class="quote">“I never wish to be easily defined. I’d rather float over other people’s minds as something strictly fluid and non-perceivable; more like a
			transparent, paradoxically iridescent creature rather than an actual person.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Diary Entry, 1914</p>

            <p class="quote">“I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- The Metamorphosis, 1915</p>

            <p class="quote">“In a way, you are poetry material; You are full of cloudy subtleties I am willing to spend a lifetime 
			figuring out. Words burst in your essence and you carry their dust in the pores of your ethereal individuality.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- Letters to Milena, 1952</p>

            <p class="quote">“It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable.”</p>
            <p class="quote-year">- The Trial, 1925</p>
